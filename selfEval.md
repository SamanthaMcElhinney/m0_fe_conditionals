# Self Evaluation

1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the comparison operators? The comparison operators seem pretty straight forward, until I try to put them in an else/if statement. 
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the logical operators? They make sense to me on their own, but writing code and correctly utilizing them is where I get more frustrated.
1. How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the if statements? I definitely need additional practice. After working through the for statements, I feel fairly more confident.
1. How much time did you spend on this lesson/topic? How did that line up with your time estimate? Honestly, probably around 6 hours now. It did not line up with my time even remotely.
1. What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that? Still need practice with conditionals, specifially using else if and else statements. I have been reviewing other sources. I plan to do practices on Code Academy as well. 
1. What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need? I still am confused with the formatting and seem to be having more problems with gitHub than my classmates. Going through the notes it, conceptually it makes sense. I just need more practice.
